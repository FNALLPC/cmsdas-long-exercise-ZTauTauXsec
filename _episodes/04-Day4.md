# Statistical Analysis


We will use the Higgs Combine Tool to do the statistical analysis. We first need to install Combine:
```shell
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
git clone https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit.git HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
cd HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit
git fetch origin
git checkout v8.1.0
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
scramv1 b clean; scramv1 b
```

As an input, Higgs Combine takes a txt based file containing the observed and expected yields. An example datacard, based on [Tables 1 and 3 of the 13 TeV Z paper](https://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/HIG-15-007/#Tab), can be found at the link below. Use this [template](https://github.com/fojensen/nanoAOD-tools/blob/cmsdas2022/analysis/datacard_mumu.txt) to create a card for your analysis.

```shell
cd ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/analysis/
combine -M FitDiagnostics datacard.txt --forceRecreateNLL --rMin=0.1 --rMax=10.
combine -M Significance datacard.txt
```
